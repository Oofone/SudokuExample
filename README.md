# Structuring Large Python Projects

## The Sudoku Solver Project

This Sudoku-Solver was one I'd built as a simple numpy experiment quite a while back, but I thought why not use it as a simple example of how to create a large project (that may optionally have large dataset(s)).

## Dataset

The dataset is from Kaggle.
